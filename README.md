This repository holds the code and text to generate my thesis for my
Masters of Arts in Economic from the University of Texas at Austin.

**_The repository is missing proprietary Bloomberg data.  Please
  contact me at michael at nahas dot com to get the data._**

Requirements:
* Quantlib (finance library)
  * python interface to Quantlib
* R
  * lmtest library 
  * sandwich library 
  * multiwayvcov library 
  * parallel library 
* python
  * matplotlib
  * scipy
  * numpy
  * pandas
* LaTeX (pdflatex)

NOTE: C# was used to download the data from Bloomberg, but is not
necessary to compile the document.

To compile, run: "make"
