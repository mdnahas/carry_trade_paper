  abstract={This paper documents that carry traders are subject to crash risk: i.e. exchange rate movements between high-interest-rate and low-interest-rate currencies are negatively skewed. We argue that this negative skewness is due to sudden unwinding of carry trades, which tend to occur in periods in which risk appetite and funding liquidity decrease. Funding liquidity measures predict exchange rate movements, and controlling for liquidity helps explain the uncovered interest-rate puzzle. Carry-trade losses reduce future crash risk, but increase the price of crash risk. We also document excess co-movement among currencies with similar interest rate. Our findings are consistent with a model in which carry traders are subject to funding liquidity constraints.},

    This paper examines the carry trade and when the market moves against it, which the authors call a "currency crash".  They say that currency crashes happen in multiple currencies at the same time and are correlated with a high VIX.  Thus, it seems currency crashes happen when banks are stressed for short-term money.  (Only one has to become stresses, since a hurried unwinding causes a large price movement, which stresses other traders positions, leading to everyone unwinding.)  The VIX data looked good, but I wasn't sold by their study of comovements of currencies.

    The paper has a noteworthy graph on page 19, Figure 5, in the upper-left region.  It shows that after a interest rate movement, the next movement is likely to be soon and in the same direction.  This may be source of profit in uncovered interest parity (UIP).  I think it was from this that they authors concluded that "carry trade activity pushes FX rates towards fundamentals rather than away from it."

    The paper showed traders positions, using open interest in futures.  (The traders seems to be doing well.)

    The authors founds skewness in the returns.  (No surprise.)  Skewness was about equal to that of the stock market.

    The authors found that positive returns held out to periods of 9 months or so.  The best returns were short-term, one or two months long.

    The authors used only 8 currencies and had futures positions on only 5.  The data covered 1986 to 2006 (starting at 1998 for some studies).

    This paper covered the carry trade and the momentum trade.  The momentum trade is: if the carry trade would have been profitable last month, do it this month.  When doing equally-weighted trades in multiple currencies at the same time, both trades have a high Sharpe ratio: 0.89 for carry and 0.62 for momentum.  Combined, the Sharpe ratio is an even higher 0.98.  They compare it to stocks, but didn't appear to measure correlation with stock returns.

   They did not see any skewness.  I find that very odd, but maybe they didn't have many countries near the ZLB.  They did see high kurtosis.

   They explain that the carry trade makes money because the current price is equal to expected value of next month's spot price, but it is not an unbiased estimator.  If the spot price is higher than the future, the carry trade makes money 57\% of the time.  The momentum trade is similar.

   They try to figure out if the carry trade profits are from some risk.  They compare it to a number of them, including "realized stock market volatility", and find only one small interaction.  They use Menkhoff2011's version of FX volatility, but it just seemed to show that high-interest rate currencies move more than low-interest rate ones.

   Section 4 is a discussion of "rare disasters", which seems to be arguing that currency profits are not a risk premium from for "rare disasters".  But a "rare disaster" would be visible in the recorded data, it next measures "peso problems", which are not seen in-sample.  They then use options prices to justify that UIP and CIP carry the same risk, I think.  They conclude that these risks don't explain the profitability of the UIP.

  Section 5 is theory on trading.  I think it says that traders will keep making the trade until the marginal trade is zero profit.  So the prices we see after trading are not profitable, but the ones who already traded are making a profit.  Thus the average trade is profitable, but trading stops.  This seems obvious to me, so I'm not sure why they included it.

  Most data was for 20 currencies, 1976 to 2000.  (They claim 1973 was the start of the post Bretton-Woods era.)  For options, they had 10 currencies from 1995-2009.

We find that high interest rate currencies are negatively related to innovations in global FX volatility and thus deliver low returns in times of unexpected high volatility, when low interest rate currencies provide a hedge by yielding positive returns. Our proxy for global FX volatility risk captures more than 90\% of the cross-sectional excess returns in five carry trade portfolios. In turn, these results provide evidence that there is an economically meaningful risk-return relation in the FX market. Further analysis shows that liquidity risk also matters for expected FX returns, but to a lesser degree than volatility risk. Finally, exposure to our volatility risk proxy also performs well for pricing returns of other cross sections in foreign exchange, U.S. equity, and corporate bond markets.},

  abstract={The carry trade is the investment strategy of going long in high-yield target currencies and short in low-yield funding currencies. Recently, this naive trade has seen very high returns for long periods, followed by large crash losses after large depreciations of the target currencies. Based on low Sharpe ratios and negative skew, these trades could appear unattractive, even when diversified across many currencies. But more sophisticated conditional trading strategies exhibit more favorable payoffs. We apply novel (within economics) binary-outcome classification tests to show that our directional trading forecasts are informative, and out-of-sample loss-function analysis to examine trading performance. The critical conditioning variable, we argue, is the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER). Expected returns are lower, all else equal, when the target currency is overvalued. Like traders, researchers should incorporate this information when evaluating trading strategies. When we do so, some questions are resolved: negative skewness is purged, and market volatility (VIX) is uncorrelated with returns; other puzzles remain: the more sophisticated strategy has a very high Sharpe ratio, suggesting market inefficiency.},

It also shows that when carry trade strategies perform well, fundamental strategies do poorly, and vice versa. Crises appear to play a significant role in the alternation of investment styles on currency markets. In contrast to carry trades, fundamental strategies perform remarkably well in crises. A portfolio that rotates between these two types of strategies, based on a risk aversion indicator such as implied equity volatility, would substantially outperform a pure carry trade strategy and would be robust to crises.},

    State the crisis was 2008-2009, not 2007-2008 --- I presume a European focus?  "Great Financial Crisis (GFC)" ... odd lingo.
    "The key message of our paper is that the value of the dollar plays the role of a barometer of risk-taking capacity in capital markets."
    Uses "cross-currency basis" to measure difference between USD interest rate in "cash market" and implied interest rate.  They compare USD to equal-weighted average of all other currencies.  Weird.  ??? Picture says "simple average" but text says "trade weighted".  Uses 5 year data!
    "export channel" vs "financial channel".  Sounds like, in response to an exchange rate move, the lowering side exports more and the rising side exports less.  Thus, the weaker side grows.  The "financial channel" is that when things improve, more investment comes in OR financial constraints loosen, so the stronger side grows.  
    !!! USD is always on one side of the EUR.  And mostly the same for the average graph.  Is this that one side of the Atlantic doesn't want to loan to the other?  Or that EUR investors want USD assets?
    It looks like international borrowing grows about 2\% per year.  When USD Broad Index (NEER) goes down, the borrowing increases more.  So when dollars are cheap, foreigners borrow more of them.  (But this seems dominated by a few extreme points.)  The authors claim the regression values are strongest 2007-2013.
    Authors point out that when the exchange rate shifts, one side has banks holding more valuable assets and which gives them more manuverability, while the other side must allocate more resources.
    !!! Huh?!  The relationship with dollar lending only exists for EUR, not other currencies!
    Figure 7 redoes the study with the EUR.  Lending drops 1\% per year and also drops when exchange rate goes up.  EUR lending factor keeps getting worse through 2015.

    Says CIP exists on 1-week forwards.
    Includes Danish Krone.   Used 5-year (and 3 month) data.
    Rejects previous claims that CIP violation is due to different LIBOR risks.  Does study using Repo and Kreditanstalt f\"u Wiederaufbau, which are German-backed bonds.  CIP violations exist, even with transaction costs included.
    Points out that CIP trade has a risk of near 0, so the Sharpe ratio should be near infinite.

    Claims CIP deviation originates from two factors: a persistant imbalance in supply and demand globally and increase costs of financial intermediation.  (Is the second "counterparty risk"?)
    Identifies 4 properties of CIP deviation:  (1) larger at end of quarter, presumably because European banks do not want to show currency arbitrage to regulators, (2) LIBOR - IOER (Interest on Excess Reserves) is the balance sheet cost for banks and explain half of CIP, (3) correlated with tenor = LIBOR 3M - LIBOR 1M movements, a liquidity measure, and (4) positive with high interest-rate currencies and negative with low ones.
    ! If (4) is true, you want to do the opposite --- borrow in high-interest rate currencies and invest in low!
    Claims that CIP deviations increases with interest rate shocks, such as policy announcements of ECB.
    ! Most UIP trading is implemented as futures, which are different from forwards.  Also, as swaps (which are like Repos).  Futures are fixed amounts, deliverable each quarter.  Both are marked-to-market and (most definitely) ensured by the CME.  Bloomberg's forwards are not.
    ! Page 26 covers leverage allowed.  The amount needed to cover leverage was small before, but now is 3\% (most banks via Basel III) or 6\% (US "too big to fail" banks).  If a bank wants a rate of return on 10\%, then they need at least $.03 \cdot .10 = .0030$, or 30 basis points to make it profitable.  The gap may not be large enough to get some to play, especially "systemetically important financial institutions" that need 6\%.
    The Volker rule prevents many US banks from propritary trading in forwards/futures.  Does this leverage rule the bank prevent hedge funds and others outside the bank from borrowing from it and levering up and taking this risk?  
    They also look at VAR (value at risk) restricting the arbitrage trade.
    To see if bank balance sheets affect things, they look at the IOER rate given by the Fed.  IOER is greater than the OIS (Fed Funds, in the US) because Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac must borrow at Fed Funds rate, causing a drop in it.  Thus, it is another perfect arbitrage to measure against.  It also measure IOER might be the lower bound for the cost of money, not FedFunds.  It wasn't clear why, but they say that explains 6 bp of the currency basis at 1 week.  
    They looked at currency moves around ECB announcements.  Not sure what the result was.

    Say that CIP is violated because of (1) demand for FX hedges and (2) constraints on arbitrage.
    Says spot market and interest rates are larger markets and drive the forward price.  Makes sense.
    With corporate bond rates lower in Europe, US companies are issuing "Reverse Yankee Bonds" --- bonds in Euros --- then converting the Euros to USD and hedging the FX exposure.  These issuances are long-term, since a wide currency basis makes short-term unprofitable.  (The Financial Times puts the reverse yankee market at ~300B EUR for each of 2013-2015.  But a BIS report http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r\_qt1509a.pdf puts it at 30B, 50B, ?100B   https://heisenbergreport.com/2017/01/08/blockbuster-corporate-bank-debt-sales-break-records-in-busy-first-week/ has it increasing from 2012, but very low in 2010 and 2011.)
    Other causes for the non-zero basis are bank's balance sheets (using swaps to cover difference between currency assets and liabilities) and financial firms, like insurance, doing strategic hedging.
    Pg. 55 shows these as different for each country, but Japan's are sizable (30\% of GDP).  Pg. 56 shows the connection to currency basis.  Japan dominates that graph.
    Claims currency arbitragers are now using Repo market (secured funding).  Both Bank of Japan and Fed have been buying bonds, making collateral scarce.  They show a graph of repo (US-JP) and currency basis, which seems to be good at first look but then doesn't quite fit.
    They point out end-of-quarter spikes in basis, similiar to others.  But they also show it is in Repo, too.
    Regression: currency basis as function of counterparty risk (Libor-OIS), funding liquidity (Repo spread), market liquidity (currency bid-ask spread).  Adding "demand" improves things ... for 3M but less on 2Y.  Repo spread seems the most significant value.

Capital flows drive exchange rates by altering the balance sheets of financiers that bear the risks resulting from international imbalances in the demand for financial assets. Such alterations to their balance sheets cause financiers to change their required compensation for holding currency risk, thus impacting both the level and volatility of exchange rates. Our theory of exchange rate determination in imperfect financial markets not only helps rationalize the empirical disconnect between exchange rates and traditional macroeconomic fundamentals, but also has real consequences for output and risk sharing. Exchange rates are sensitive to imbalances in financial markets and seldom perform the shock absorption role that is central to traditional theoretical macroeconomic analysis. Our framework is flexible; it accommodates a number of important modeling features within an imperfect financial market model, such as non-tradables, production, money, sticky prices or wages, various forms of international pricing-to-market, and unemployment.},

This violation of the Law-of-One-Price (LOOP) in credit risk is closely aligned with violations of covered interest rate parity in the time series and the cross-section of currencies. I explain this phenomenon with a model of market segmentation. Post-crisis regulations and intermediary frictions have severely impaired arbitrage in the exchange rate and credit markets each on their own, but capital flows, either currency-hedged investment or debt issuance, bundle together the two LOOP violations. Limits of arbitrage spill over from one market to another.},

    Credit spread is the cost of issuing the same debt in different currencies.  E.g., right now, it is cheaper to issue debt in the EUR zone than in the US.  Claims credit spread (USD vs EUR rate) of 70 bp on \$13T of all corporate debt is worth \$25B.
    Claims credit spread sometimes leads, sometimes follows currency basis.  But they are highly correlated (80\%).
    Builds model with debt markets in 2 currencies, 2 debt issuers who only issue in their respective market, a spot and forward currency market, an FX arbitrager in both, and then a representative agent who could issue debt locally and/or issue it in the foreign market with a hedge.  The amount issued locally and foreign is determined by markets - deviation in one currency forwards affects deviations in credit spread and vise versa.
    "A counterintuitive implication of the model, which also appears in the data, is that the net deviation from LOOP is small even when both deviations in CIP and credit are large individually."
    Companies issuing make the different in currency rates \emph{minus} the currency basis, because of hedging. So, it seems like they say debt issuance drives the CIP.
    Cites Du2016, Ivashina2015, Sushko2016
    Looks at bonds issued by same corporation in different currencies.  Based on currency, time, firm, maturity, and rating, find the currency effect was near 0 for 2004 to 2007.  After, some go to -100 bp relative to USD!   (They claim this approach is better than using B-of-A and Barclays bond indices, and I agree.)  (Adding seniority and time-since-issue did not help much.)  Rating changes scale.  Looking at soveriegn bonds yields similar results.
    Claims bank doesn't arb away CIP because they are holding positions in currencies.  Hedge funds don't do it because they can't get loans at LIBOR or OIS rates.  (But claims hedge funds \emph{do} arb the term structure of currency forwards.)  Basil III raised costs for holding arb positions; and other more regulation.
    Claims investors often can't look overseas - restrictions on currency exposure, nativism, etc..  Some follow local benchmarks.

The CIP deviation exists with respect to several different dollar-denominated interest rates and exchange rate pairings of the dollar vis-a-vis other currencies. The results show that our proxies for margin conditions and for the cost of capital are significant determinants of the CIP deviations, especially during the crisis period. The supply of dollars by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks via reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) reduced CIP deviations at this time. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, uncertainty about counterparty risk became a significant determinant of CIP deviations, and the swap lines program no longer affected the CIP deviations significantly. These results indicate a breakdown of arbitrage transactions in the international capital markets that owes partly to lack of capital and partly to heightened counterparty credit risk. Central bank interventions helped reduce the funding liquidity risk of global institutions.},

We find that CIP holds remarkably well for most potential arbitrageurs when applying their marginal funding rates. With severe funding liquidity differences, however, it becomes impossible for dealers to quote prices such that CIP holds across the full rate spectrum. A narrow set of global top-tier banks enjoys risk-less arbitrage opportunities as dealers set quotes to avert order flow imbalances. We show how a situation with persistent arbitrage profits arises as an equilibrium outcome due to the constellation of market segmentation, the abundance of excess reserves and their remuneration in central banks' deposit facilities.},

    Author separate the Law of One Price (LOOP) from CIP.  LOOP provides incentives to cross borders; CIP is associated with "risk-less profits from a self-financing roundtrip arbitrage".

    Figure 3 looks at CIP Basis as being caused by liquidity premia.  That is, the difference in cost between overnight rates and 3-month rates.  Eqn 4 says the bank's 3-month rate is equal to the risk-free rate, the bank's risk, plus a liquidity premium.  They extract these premium using averaging, from a regression formula like Liao's (eqn 5).  Then, figure 3 shows that the premia and CIP Basis are highly correlated.  (Why not use 3-month govt bonds?)  BUT this is a trick.  It is Liao all over again.  It's just saying that CIP basis with 3-month borrowing and 3-month forwards is lower than CIP-basis using OIS and 3-month forwards!

    They use bank's commercial paper (CP) rate as the bank's funding cost.  Given that, they say LOOP deviations exist for high-quality banks using govt bills and for most banks using central bank deposits.  Although, few banks have access to those deposits.

     Claims pre-crisis, banks credit risk was mostly small and aligned across countries.  Similarly, liquidity premia were small and aligned too.

      Post-crisis, they claim there's too many dollars, yen, euros.  The market can absorb dollars, but euros and yen sit in central bank deposits.  Thus, good and bad banks just get the deposit rate.  The price of liquidity is the same for all.  The price of liquidity doesn't change, because the opportunity cost is the deposit rate.

     But exist for LIBOR, OIS, and GC repo rates.  They also say that risk-free CIP arbitrage opportunities do indeed exist, but only for a few highly-rated global banks.  Only a few have CP rates low enough to do it.  The authors think that inter-bank deposits are better for risk-free arbitrage than government securities, because the price of govt. securities changes as your volume increases.  Deposits, kept at the central bank, give a constant return for all volumes.
    Given a variety of funding costs for banks, marketmakers in FX forwards cannot have a single price that works for all.  They must pick a price that balances flows.

     Investigates the negative swap spread (spread of swap rate over treasury rate) for long-term securities.  The usual arbitrage would be to buy the treasury using REPO and then buy the swap, using the variable 3-month swap rate to pay the overnight REPO rate.  But there is a liquidity risk, that the 3-month rate will be less than the REPO.
     Using a model, they find the negative swap spread is linear with the term spread.  It looks to be more magnified by lower interest rates and more frictions.

The inflation rate can be and has been negative, most recently (in the United States) during the Great Depression. The nominal short rate is the 'shadow real interest rate' (as defined by the investment opportunity set) plus the inflation rate, or zero, whichever is greater. Thus the nominal short rate is an option. Longer term interest rates are always positive, since the future short rate may be positive even when the current short rate is zero. We can easily build this option element into our interest rate trees for backward induction or Monte Carlo simulation: just create a distribution that allows negative nominal rates, and then replace each negative rate with zero.

  Measured on 3 month scale, using London's Euroyen and Eurodollar deposits as well as "RJA", a Japanese 3-month repo, and "RUS", the "prime industrial paper rate in the U.S.".  The CIP violations (I think) came in London, where the EuroYen market was thin.  (Which is expected, with export controls.)

Focusing on the basis against the US dollar (USD), we show that the CIP deviations that are not due to transaction costs or bank credit risk can be explained by the demand to hedge USD forward. Fluctuations in FX hedging demand matter because committing the balance sheet to arbitrage is costly. With limits to arbitrage, CIP arbitrageurs charge a premium in the forward markets for taking the other side of FX hedgers' demand. We find that measures of FX hedging demand, combined with proxies for the risks associated with CIP arbitrage, improve the explanatory power of standard regressions.},

We find that the use of the Federal Reserve's USD central bank swap lines was mainly related to tensions in US money markets during times of financial crisis, and less to tensions which were confined to foreign exchange swap markets. In particular, we find that the use of USD central bank swap lines did not react significantly to the recent period of persistent deviations of covered interest parity (CIP) since 2014. These results are consistent with the view that the Federal Reserve was guided by enlightened self-interest when providing swap lines to foreign central banks, in order to reduce dislocations in US financial markets and support financial stability. In recent years foreign exchange swap markets have not functioned properly, but it appears that now that the crisis is over, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have decided against trying permanently to fill the gap left by the dysfunction in the commercial foreign exchange swap market.},
