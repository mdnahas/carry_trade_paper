% Uncomment the line below that corresponds to the type of master's

% Some optional commands to change the document's defaults.	     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%\singlespacing
%\oneandonehalfspacing

%\singlespacequote
\oneandonehalfspacequote

\topmargin 0.125in	% Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
			% of your dissertation has incorrect top and 
			% bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
			% full page of your dissertation (not the first
			% page of a chapter) and measure the top and
			% bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
			% a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
			% at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
			% least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
			% If the margins are not correct, adjust this
			% value accordingly and re-compile and print again.
			%
			% The default value is 0.125"

		% If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
		% utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
		% the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
		% your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
		% utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
		% made to utdiss2.sty.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Some optional commands to be tested.				     %

% If there are 10 or more sections, 10 or more subsections for a section,

First, the major result of Liao (2016) was reproduced, with 3 additional currencies and 6 more years of data.  [Gordon Y. Liao. Credit Migration and Covered Interest Rate Parity. Working Paper 468601, Harvard University, October 2016.]   Second, Liao's model was tested using government rates, which showed a better fit than when using swap rates, as in Liao's work.  Lastly, CIP deviations were calculated from long-term corporate bond rates.  Since 2012, the CIP deviations measured using corporate bonds are lower than those calculated from swap and government rates, and are of a scale where banks could be expected to make arbitrage trades.
