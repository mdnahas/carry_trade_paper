    Short-term interest rates are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market. Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are "money market rate" and "treasury bill rate".},

The Vix Index was introduced in 1993 by Professor Robert E. Whaley of Duke University in his paper "Derivatives on Market Volatility: Hedging Tools Long Overdue," Journal of Derivatives 1 (Fall 1993), pp. 71-84. Since then, VIX has been considered by many to be the world's premier barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility.

The New VIX still measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility, but in a way that conforms to the latest thinking and research among industry practitioners. The New VIX is based on S\&P 500 index option prices and incorporates information from the volatility "skew" by using a wider range of strike prices rather than just at-the-money series.},

     Quoting Wikipedia: "The Bloomberg Terminal is a computer system provided by the financial data vendor Bloomberg L.P. that enables professionals in finance and other industries to access the Bloomberg Professional service through which users can monitor and analyze real-time financial market data and place trades on the electronic trading platform.[1] The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary secure network."

     Bloomberg Professional service has historical prices on many financial instruments.  I collected data on currency spot prices, currency forwards, and risk reversal as well as interest rates from government securities, interbank loans, and money markets.  I gather this from at least 11 currencies from 1973 to mid-2016.  Some instruments did not exist and, for others, data was not available for the complete period.  Prices, where available, included the open, close, high, and low.
