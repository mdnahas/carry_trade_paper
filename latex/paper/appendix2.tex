\section{Liao's Net Deviation} \label{net_deviation_data}

Liao's regression on corporate bonds to compute ``net deviation'' is similar to mine to compute CIP basis.  (Compare equations~\eqref{liao_regression} and~\eqref{second_model}.)  This appendix presents plots of the 9 currencies comparing the results in Figures~\ref{LiaoSendup_EUR} through~\ref{LiaoSendup_NZD}.  

For this section, I use Liao's first definition of net deviation, which is the residualized credit spread difference (RCSD) minus the CIP basis.  The CIP basis here is the 5-year CIP basis.  Both the RCSD and CIP bases are computed using swap rates.  I did not use Liao's refined definition on page 29 of his paper\cite{Liao2016} where the value for CIP basis is moved into the regression and the horizon of the CIP basis is selected to match the maturity of the bond.
